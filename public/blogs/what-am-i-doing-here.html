    <main>
        <p>It's difficult to think of what needs to be said, but the first sentiment is a gimme: Welcome to my first blog post, and thank you for reading. ❤️</p>
        <p>I've been talking to a friend, <a href="https://petal-pusher.world/">Petals</a>, about what I would like this page to be. For instance, I used to consider myself to be a creative first and foremost, and I still do on some level, but now going into adulthood I've become settled. I've found that I have, in fact, become another casualty of society.</p> 
        <p>What does one do when their purpose is buried beneath six years of creative inaction, bills, and day jobs? Do I want to rekindle the flame of a surf-rock punk band doused by apathy and a global pandemic? Not particularly, especially considering we're not even all alive anymore (rest in peace, Jack). What about trying to become a famous movie director by half-assing a general studies degree at a university known for pumping out lawyers, accountants, and failed business majors turned insurance salesmen? The laws of nature didn't allow it then, I don't think it's plausible now. Should I try to start my umpeenth business? Become an actor? Screenwriter? Doesn't work. Can't act. Refer to the point about becoming a director.</p>
        <p>I swear I'm a positive person, that's why I'm here. I'm simply commiserating with myself in the void as I try to find the words for this post without continuously breaking the fourth wall.</p>
        <p>Anyway, this website has begun to speak to me, as most things do when you stare at them long enough. I'm going to take a note from Petal's page and treat this as the repository of me. If I were to take more notes from Petal's page I'd have a garden and a beautiful concept of community, but we're going to start with simply the repository. In this website will live content from myself and others in the form of stories, music, and development projects, while the blogs will remain written by myself.</p>
        <p>This website will also, ultimately, be a playground. I've started by adding a digital piano in lieu of a swing set, though, so you don't break your computer. I added functionality to allow for sparks to fly when you click. At first I thought it was nifty, but then I touched the screen sporadically enough to make it look like fireworks. The point is that I want you to have the space to be creative, too. Who knows what fireworks you'll find given enough gun powder. Give me time to grow your space.</p>
        <p>Lastly, currently, selfishly with a capital "I": I want this site to be freedom for myself. I want to unearth every passion I've ever had and tried to monetize and do it because I want to. I believe that the passions listed are real and innate within myself, but something in me always tried to monetize them. Is that on me, or is that a reflection of how I, maybe we, have been raised? Not sure, and frankly it's not the issue being handled by this site. I'm not here to solve the problem of why we cannot simply have hobbies without monetizing them. I'm not here to figure out how to break out of living paycheck to paycheck. I'm currently here, for the first time in my life, to live my passions outside of an ugly, defiling grind.</p>
        <p>I'm glad you're here. Please stick around.</p>
