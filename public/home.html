                    I'm currently a programmer, hope to stay that way, but before I was an avid, self-taught musician
                    and
                    passionate about
                    telling stories through visual and written media. This is my personal site to explore some of my old
                    hobbies. Please enjoy, and if you have stories, music, or open source projects you like, please

                        that I'm an expert in the subject by any means). I've always been a hard worker but
                        bearing
                        responsibility long term isn't something you can just brute force and knock out with
                        elbow
                        grease. I'm learning that it's just kind of something you have to learn to live with

                        you
                        reach a certain point in your life if you're fortunate enough. I can tell you that it
                        definitely
                        isn't going away anytime soon, in fact it looks like it'll be getting heavier in the
