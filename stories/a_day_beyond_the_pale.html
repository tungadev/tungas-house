            Early in the morning, before the sun rises, a farmer steps outside and looks the stars.
            <br /><br />
            With a steaming cup of black coffee in his hand, he pulls out his phone to check the weather for the day.
            The light of the phone almost hurts his eyes in the early morning darkness. With a wince and a grunt, He
            quickly gets
            what he needs and puts his cracked phone back in the pocket of his wispy, pale blue jeans. He didn't want
            the phone,
            he liked watching early morning reruns of the weather channel before his old box television broke. His wife
            convinced him to get the phone, primarily to keep up with their grand kids. They never talk, but not for
            lack of wanting. He doesn't want to be a bother, and they'll call if they want to talk.
            <br /><br />
            The weather should be good enough for market and to knock out some field work later in the afternoon. The
            animals will need to
            be taken care of regardless. With a soft huff in the silent darkness, the farmer begins his morning.
            <br /><br />
            His first stop every morning is to greet the chickens. Soft clucks escape from the imperfect wooden coop as
            the chickens hear footsteps cut through the silent morning. He wanted to buy the chickens full grown, but
            his wife said she wanted to raise them from chicks. Now instead of nameless chickens, he has Denise, Jewel,
            and Gabby. They had more at first, but with time he was left with three.
            <br /><br />
