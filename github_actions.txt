Skipping workflow runs
You can skip workflow runs triggered by the push and pull_request events by including a command in your commit message.

Note

If a workflow is skipped due to path filtering, branch filtering or a commit message (see below), then checks associated with that workflow will remain in a "Pending" state. A pull request that requires those checks to be successful will be blocked from merging.

Workflows that would otherwise be triggered using on: push or on: pull_request won't be triggered if you add any of the following strings to the commit message in a push, or the HEAD commit of a pull request:

[skip ci]
[ci skip]
[no ci]
[skip actions]
[actions skip]
